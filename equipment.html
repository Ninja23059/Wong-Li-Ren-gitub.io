  <h1> What equipment are good? </h1>
  <p> Talking about equipment, we will focus on gun type </p>
</header>
<h3> Pistol </h3>
<p> good for early game, but dont rely on it unless you are in a ammoless situation </p>
<h3> Shotgun </h3>
<p> critical damage when close range, it is best weapon if you are in a situation when you are close-ranged surrounded, not recommended to use it mid-range nor long-range </p>
  <h3> Assault Rifle </h3>
  <p> decent weapon type, can do all short, medium and long range, Assault weapon mainly used for long-battle type and pressuring enemy, although required lots of part to maximize its full potential </p>
    <h3> Submachine gun </h3>
    <p> either quick firerate or higher damage compared to assault rifle, mainly used for short range and some occasion for mid-range. Unlike assault rifle, using it right could also exert most of its potential </p>
    <h3> light machine gun </h3>
    <p> high ammo usage, but great at pressuring enemy, mostly use for vehicle battle to sustain dps on enemy, recommended in team battle </p>
    <h3> Sniper rifle </h3>
    <p> although damage is high among all weapon type, its low firerate makes it suitable for long range only, suitable at high ground </p>
      <h3> marksman rifle </h3>
      <p> it have similarity with sniper rifle but it has balanced damage and fire rate, suitable during long range and medium range fight, but only for support role </p>
